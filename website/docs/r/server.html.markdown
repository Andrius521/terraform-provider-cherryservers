# cherryservers\_server

Provides a CherryServers Server resource. This can be used to create,
modify, and delete Servers. Servers also support
[provisioning](/docs/provisioners/index.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "region" {
  default = "EU-East-1"
}
variable "image" {
  default = "Ubuntu 18.04 64bit"
}
variable "plan_id" {
  default = "86"
}
# Create a new Web Server in the EU-East-1 region
# Optional provisioning is specified as well.
resource "cherryservers_server" "my-server" {
  project_id = "${cherryservers_project.myproject.id}"
  region = "${var.region}"
  hostname = "production_server"
  image = "${var.image}"
  plan_id = "${var.plan_id}"
  ssh_keys_ids = [
    "${cherryservers_ssh.mykey.id}"]
  ip_addresses_ids = [
    "${cherryservers_ip.my-ip.id}"]

  # Upload your setup script
  provisioner "file" {
    source = "my_setup_script.sh"
    destination = "/tmp/my_setup_script.sh"

    connection {
      type = "ssh"
      user = "root"
      host = "${self.primary_ip}"
      private_key = "${file(var.private_key)}"
      timeout = "20m"
    }
  }
  # Make setup script executable and run it
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "chmod +x /tmp/my_setup_script.sh",
      "/tmp/my_setup_script.sh",
    ]
    connection {
      type = "ssh"
      user = "root"
      host = "${self.primary_ip}"
      private_key = "${file(var.private_key)}"
      timeout = "20m"
    }
  }
}
```
